Idea: Carbon Footprint's

Global warming has become one of the world’s most disastrous problem today. Global warming is the leading cause for many natural disasters such as melting of polar ice caps, which leads to floods and the death of many marine organisms. The main cause for global warming is greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emission is the total output of greenhouse gas emissions caused by a person, organisation, event or product, and can be measured by calculating the carbon footprint.

The calculation can be done as follows: An individual can input his/ her daily usage of electricity (natural gas, heating oil emissions), transportation (public or private vehicle emissions) or domestic (fridge, AC emissions). Formulas can be used to calculate the carbon emissions from the data input by the user of the app. For example, the electricity, the user can input the electricity bill values throughout the year, then by using the formula, according to ISO 14064:

 Input value (in KWh/Yr) X 0.85 (Emission Factor) = Output value in (Kg of CO2)
The same can be done for the rest of the data collected. By adding all the output values, the overall carbon footprint can be calculated.

Hence the total carbon footprint is then displayed along with which activity’s carbon emissions are the highest and suggestions as to how one can reduce his/her carbon footprint, such as changing his/her AC, using a catalyst in the fuel of the used vehicle, etc. 
The data from each user can be amassed together to get an overview of how much green house gases are emitted in a particular area. An average carbon footprint of the given area is calculated. By sending the information to the necessary authorities, the required measures can be adopted in the said area to curb the emissions. This data on various sectors’ carbon footprint is also accessible by the user, as he can avoid places with greater greenhouse gas emission, for the sake of health or for any other purpose. 

Having calculated the user’s carbon footprint, it is the user’s duty to reduce his/her carbon footprint. By taking into consideration suggestions offered by the app, the user can take part in the overall reduction of an area’s carbon footprint reduction. Small steps can lead to big miracles; hence reducing one’s carbon footprint can reduce the occurrence of natural disasters and Global Warming.
