Natural Disaster Management

Idea: Tornado Watch  
Natural disasters are the leading cause of death in the world today, claiming mass numbers with every occurrence. Therefore the prevention and detection of natural disasters using modern technology and platforms is vital and in tune with the current progress of humanity. 
Tornadoes are one such class of natural disasters, they can be classified as cyclones but over landmasses. Reaching speeds of up to 260mph, and having immense destructive power, a tornado can claim up to millions of dollars’ worth of property damage, and leave hundreds more injured. Thus, predicting and managing tornadoes is a very interesting field of study.  

This project aims to do just that. It aims to predict the occurrence of tornadoes by gathering relevant information pertaining to weather forecasts. Once the relevant fields are obtained further screening of data will on the basis of the leading climatic factors that influence the formation of tornadoes.

The four main ingredients which lead to the formation of a tornado are: 

Shear (The changing of wind with height, direction or speed)  

Lift (components that lift an air mass) 

Instability (warm at the surface and cooling above) 

Moisture (higher amounts of humidity, the basic fuel of thunder storms) 

The app in concern will analyze the different weather patterns that lead up to a favorable build up to the above mentioned ingredients, by scanning through real time data gathered from previous incidents. Then it will use machine learning modules in order to predict tornadoes in future circumstances under the same developing weather conditions. It will also alert the localities under the danger zone we ascertained and local help groups to aid in disaster management. 

The dataset we will use, should be able to give us the parameters we require either directly (i.e.: if the values are directly present and we need not modify the data) or indirectly (i.e.: if the values are obtained through different computational means from existing data).

A demonstration of the functionality of this app to validate it's working would be on the following terms, we would first extract all relevant data from a given dataset consisting of climatic conditions a few weeks or months leading to the known occurrence of a tornado. We would the use our application to predict to a certain accuracy the location and time of the tornado. Further we would send warnings and alerts to all the localities in the danger zone and also to relief organizations in the near by regions. Safety spots and safe haven’s can also be issued to the population under consideration.

We expect this new approach to dramatically reduce the cost of the entire process, improve the efficiency of the entire process and  not only be very accurate in the predictions of the time of occurrence or the type of tornado  but also in determining the region of it’s effect and avoid casualties to a bare minimum by all means.
